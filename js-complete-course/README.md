# La Prairie: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

## Structure

The file consists of 48 exercises, divided into 7 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Each exercise must be done.  
NOTE: **Note: **The exercises in series 7 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

#### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  
This is a good practice that should always be applied. I recommend that you install[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machines, then install[**sèvè**](https://github.com/leny/seve), a small utility that generates a local server from your command line.

## Notes to self

* document.getElementById("......").addEventListener("click", function() 

### 01 Base

### 02 Math 

*Factorial*
I could have also used the below function (the ? is a form of mini if else - more research needed.)
function factorial(n) {
    return (n != 1) ? n * factorial(n - 1) : 1;
}



### 03 Colours

### 04 Dates

### 05 Arrays

confused by 5.10, I'm trying to just pull out the ages from the array but having trouble. I found this 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19590865/from-an-array-of-objects-extract-value-of-a-property-as-array
but I don't understand .map. I need to research more.
